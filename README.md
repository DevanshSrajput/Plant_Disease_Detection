## About

Welcome to the **Plant Disease Detection System** ‚Äì the AI-powered tool that helps you identify plant diseases from leaf images. Why consult an expert when you can trust a neural network trained on thousands of images to make a wild guess? This project leverages deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras) and Streamlit to bring you a modern, interactive web app for plant health analysis.

Whether you're a farmer, a botanist, or just someone who likes to upload random pictures of leaves, this tool is for you!

---

## Features

- **Disease Detection**: Upload a plant leaf image and let the AI diagnose it (or at least try).
- **Model Training**: Train your own model on the PlantVillage dataset. Because who doesn't love waiting for epochs to finish?
- **System Info**: See what‚Äôs happening under the hood. Or just admire your hardware.
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive, and full of green gradients. Because plants.
- **Ultra-Fast Mode**: For those who want results before their coffee gets cold (accuracy not guaranteed).
- **Custom & Transfer Learning**: Choose between a custom CNN or transfer learning with state-of-the-art models.
- **Logs & Metrics**: Watch your model learn. Or overfit. Or both.

## Installation

> **Warning:** This project requires Python 3.8+ and a working sense of humor.

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-detection.git
    cd plant-disease-detection
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download the PlantVillage dataset**
    - [Kaggle PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset)
    - Extract it to `data/plantvillage/` so you have folders like:
      ```
      data/
        plantvillage/
          Apple___Apple_scab/
          Tomato___Late_blight/
          ...
      ```

4. **Run the launcher**
    ```bash
    python launch.py
    ```
    This will check your environment, install missing packages, and open the app in your browser. If it doesn't, you probably have bigger problems.

## Usage

1. **Train a Model**
    - Go to the **Train Model** tab.
    - Pick your favorite model type (or just the fastest).
    - Click "Start Training" and watch the logs. Or go make a sandwich.
    - When done, your model will be saved in the `models/` directory.

2. **Detect Disease**
    - Go to the **Disease Detection** tab.
    - Load a trained model from the sidebar.
    - Upload a clear image of a plant leaf.
    - Get your diagnosis. (Disclaimer: Not a substitute for a real plant pathologist.)

3. **System Info**
    - Visit the **System Info** tab to see your hardware specs, available models, and other details you‚Äôll probably ignore.

- **What‚Äôs inside:**  
  - How to set up the dataset  
  - Training a model (with minimal existential dread)  
  - Uploading images and getting predictions  
  - Navigating the UI like a pro  
  - Watching the AI confidently misdiagnose your houseplants

## Troubleshooting

- **App won‚Äôt start?**  
  Make sure you‚Äôre in the right directory and have Python 3.8+ installed. If not, ask your nearest teenager for help.

- **Training is slow!**  
  Use "Ultra Fast" mode. Or buy a GPU. Or both.

- **Predictions are always the same?**  
  Check your dataset for class imbalance. Or maybe your plant really is that sick.

- **Getting 'Disease: Unknown'?**  
  Make sure your dataset folders follow the `Plant___Disease` naming convention. The AI is picky.

- **Still stuck?**  
  Open an issue or, better yet, try turning it off and on again.
